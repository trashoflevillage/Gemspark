# Gemspark
Gemspark is a text-based programming language with the purpose of being translated to **DiamondFire** code. If you are unfamiliar with what **DiamondFire** is, visit [this site](https://mcdiamondfire.com/about/).

Do note, the documentation of this language **does not** expect you to understand how to code in DiamondFire. This documentation attempts to explain everything necessary as thorough as possible.
This documentation assumes that you are utilizing the default library.

To create a Gemspark program, use the `.gs` file extension.
