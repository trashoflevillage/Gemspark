# Gemspark
Gemspark is a text-based programming language with the purpose of being translated to **DiamondFire** code. If you are unfamiliar with what **DiamondFire** is, visit [this site](https://mcdiamondfire.com/about/).

Do note, the documentation of this language **does not** expect you to understand how to code in DiamondFire. This documentation attempts to explain everything necessary as thorough as possible.
